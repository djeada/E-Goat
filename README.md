# Can you use it to communicate with devices outside your LAN?

you may be running into an ISP problem because you have a residential network, and they all have a clause in the terms of use that forbid running a service to the Internet, and some ISPs actively block that. 

 In any case, to use IPv4, you must have an IPv4 WAN address on your router, otherwise it seems your ISP is using NAT, so you cannot forward a port and use IPv4. For IPv6, you use the Global IPv6 address assigned to your server, not the WAN address.
